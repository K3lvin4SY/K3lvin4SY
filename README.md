### Welcome to me!
I'm 20 years old and study computer science at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (LTH).
I do all my projects and coding here and like to dabble around with small coding ideas I get sometimes =)

## Personal projects I'm working on right now

### [Task Manager](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Task-Manager "Read More")
A full-stack project with frontend, backend, and MongoDB that will be able to handle and show users tasks.

### [Path Finder Example Test with React](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Path-Finder-React-Example)
A small test I wanted to do where I have implemented a size-adjustable grid that will have a pathfinder integrated later on.

You can find the unfinished project deployment [here.](https://k3lvin4sy.github.io/Path-Finder-React-Example/)

## Finished personal projects

### [Slider Puzzle](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Slider-Puzzle)
A small HTML slider puzzle game along with tools to edit the game environment and lets the user mix and solve the puzzle either themselves or with a pathfinding algorithm (A*)
You can find the Slider Puzzle [here.](https://k3lvin4sy.github.io/Slider-Puzzle/)

### [Pixel Territory](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Pixel-Territory)
A small Scala multiplayer game, where the objective is to capture small squares of territory which the whole map is built of.
In this project, I have created and used a couple of algorithms. I have also used A* in this project.

### [Ludo](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Ludo)
The Ludo game but it's made in Python and with an addition of being able to plat with bots.
With the built-in map builder, it's possible to create your own maps.

### [Steam Inventory History Filter Extension](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Steam-Inventory-History-Filter-Extension)
A Chrome extension I built for a part of Steam's website.
Specifically for the game Counter-Strike, where you can with this extension search, filter, sort, and view all of your Inventory History.
You can find the web extension [here.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/csgo-history-utility-filt/deikmkamfnmgcpdncpekplbihdnhgncd?pli=1)

More info is in its own [README.md](https://github.com/K3lvin4SY/Steam-Inventory-History-Filter-Extension/blob/main/README.md) file.
